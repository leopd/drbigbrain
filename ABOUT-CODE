** How the code is organized.
(...still in the process of formalizing this...)

*Directory-level dependencies:

/flashcards/
(Rename to "content")
Base model classes.  Just represents the learning content.
Little to no UI


/deck/
Depends on /flashcards/
Data model for user responses ("Impressions").
Code for the learning models.
UI for managing your deck.
No UI for studying or learning.  Generic for any study UI.


/study/
Depends on /flashcards/ and /deck/
UI for showing flashcards, getting user feedback.




/welcome/
UI to greet new users and get them into the system.
Depends on lots of other stuff.
