MYSQL commands to upgrade database:

./manage.py dbshell

RENAME TABLE study_deckstate TO deck_deckstate;
RENAME TABLE study_impression TO deck_impression;
    (need to rename the tables since they moved python modules)

DELETE FROM deck_deckstate;
    (the pickled models are all invalid since they point to the wrong module.)
