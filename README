** INSTALL NOTES:
Note, your mysql database must have a reasonable character set.

in mysql shell, type "STATUS" command to tell.
if it's latin1, try drop dbbpy and then
create database dbbpy character set = ucs2;

To load all BLCU content, run:
 python flashcards/bulk_loader.py content/vocab-all-blcu.csv


** DREAMHOST NOTES:
dojango in installed_apps in settings.py causes "Premature end of script headers."

need to add line
	if sys.version < "2.6": os.execl("/home/xanaguy/opt/bin/python", "python", *sys.argv)
to passenger_wsgi.py near top to get it to run my python.



** DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

current state: 
-very close to having a usable BLCU trainer on mini.
-needs an algorithm better than "randomcard"



TODOÉ
*Basic studying
(using dojo for client-side. -- in dojango branch in git)
X -Study UI
X -Impression table
X -user, login integration
-keyboard shortcuts on studyui
X -active lesson chooser ui
X -randomcard algorithm
-abstract out learningmodel
-encapsulation of login/logout from urls.py
-deck of cards algorithm
-guest login
-ert algoritm


*Better tools for adding content
-custom widget to choose concepts in a lessonseq
-lesson grouping into topics



*CLIENT-FRAMEWORK
using dojo for now.
