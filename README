** What is DrBigBrain?

DrBigBrain is an open flashcard studying tool.

See it running at http://www.drbigbrain.com/ 

Right now it only has a set of lessons for learning to read Chinese.  I hope to incorporate many other lessons as time goes on, and provide tools by which it's easy to add your own lessons. 

It is designed to compliment an existing course of study.
It is a NON-GOAL to provide a complete learning experience.  (For now.)

Right now, it just does text flashcards.
A near-term step is to expand it to support images and audio files and
build a free, open experience similar to rosetta stone's excellent language
learning software.

* Contributions, Code

I welcome contributions!

The code is django/python on the server, with dojo/javascript on the client.  

The "learning model" which figures out which card to show the user based on what they've learned so far, is abstracted out of the UI, making it easy to improve.  
For more on how the code is organized see the file ABOUT-CODE

* Supported Platforms

It works well on Desktop and good mobile browsers.  (iPhone, Android)
I test it regularly on Chrome and Android browsers, and sometimes on Firefox and Safari.  IE does not get much attention, but seems to generally work.
