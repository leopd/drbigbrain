** What is DrBigBrain?

DrBigBrain is an open flashcard studying tool.

It is live at http://www.drbigbrain.com/ with a set of lessons for learning to read Chinese.  I hope to incorporate many other lessons as time goes on, and provide tools by which it's easy to add your own lessons. 

The code is django/python with some dojo on the client.  I welcome contributions.
The "learning model" which figures out which card to show the user based on what they've learned so far, is abstracted out of the UI, making it easy to improve.  Currently the only learning models are fairly simple.



** INSTALL NOTES:
Note, your mysql database must have a reasonable character set.

in mysql shell, type "STATUS" command to tell.
if it's latin1, try drop dbbpy and then
create database dbbpy character set = ucs2;

To load all BLCU content, run:
 python flashcards/bulk_loader.py content/vocab-all-blcu.csv


** DREAMHOST NOTES:
The production system is running on Dreamhost.
Pay attention to settings.py on production.
dojango in installed_apps in settings.py causes "Premature end of script headers."

need to add line
	if sys.version < "2.6": os.execl("/home/username/opt/bin/python", "python", *sys.argv)
to passenger_wsgi.py near top to get it to run my python.



** DEVELOPMENT NOTES, TODO ROADMAP:

current state: 
-approaching a useful study tool?
-needs a CSS makeover.


TODO...

-add timer to studyui, impression table
-hints in studyui
-show name of lesson you're working on in studyui.
-bug whereby it sometimes shows the same thing twice in a row
!-javascript log when impression recording doesn't work
!-pre-load next card in studyui

*cleanup
-generalize which assettypes to display
-use lessonsequence in learningmodel to derive order
-ert algoritm
-"card" concept for which types of assets


*Login, frame UI
-encapsulation of login/logout from urls.py
-guest login
-add "about" page


*Better tools for adding content
-custom widget to choose concepts in a lessonseq
-lesson grouping into topics



*Tests
