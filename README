** What is DrBigBrain?

DrBigBrain is an open flashcard studying tool.

It is live at http://www.drbigbrain.com/ with a set of lessons for learning to read Chinese.  I hope to incorporate many other lessons as time goes on, and provide tools by which it's easy to add your own lessons. 

The code is django/python with some dojo on the client.  I welcome contributions.
The "learning model" which figures out which card to show the user based on what they've learned so far, is abstracted out of the UI, making it easy to improve.  Currently the only learning models are fairly simple.


** INSTALL NOTES:
Note, your mysql database must have a reasonable character set.

in mysql shell, type "STATUS" command to tell.
if it's latin1, try drop dbbpy and then
create database dbbpy character set = ucs2;

To load all BLCU content, run:
 python flashcards/bulk_loader.py content/vocab-all-blcu.csv


** DREAMHOST NOTES:
The production system is running on Dreamhost.
Pay attention to settings.py on production.
dojango in installed_apps in settings.py causes "Premature end of script headers."

need to add line
	if sys.version < "2.6": os.execl("/home/username/opt/bin/python", "python", *sys.argv)
to passenger_wsgi.py near top to get it to run correct version of python.
(Needs at least 2.4 or something)
