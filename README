** INSTALL NOTES:
Note, your mysql database must have a reasonable character set.

in mysql shell, type "STATUS" command to tell.
if it's latin1, try drop dbbpy and then
create database dbbpy character set = ucs2;

To load all BLCU content, run:
 python flashcards/bulk_loader.py content/vocab-all-blcu.csv


** DREAMHOST NOTES:
dojango in installed_apps in settings.py causes "Premature end of script headers."

need to add line
	if sys.version < "2.6": os.execl("/home/xanaguy/opt/bin/python", "python", *sys.argv)
to passenger_wsgi.py near top to get it to run my python.



** DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

current state: 
-barely usable BLCU trainer.
-login UI is really rough.
-needs an algorithm better than "randomcard"



TODOÉ

	-create account logs you in too.
-keyboard shortcuts on studyui
-abstract out learningmodel
-encapsulation of login/logout from urls.py
