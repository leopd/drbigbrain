** What is DrBigBrain?

DrBigBrain is an open flashcard studying tool.

It is live at http://www.drbigbrain.com/ with a set of lessons for learning to read Chinese.  I hope to incorporate many other lessons as time goes on, and provide tools by which it's easy to add your own lessons. 

The code is django/python with some dojo on the client.  I welcome contributions.
The "learning model" which figures out which card to show the user based on what they've learned so far, is abstracted out of the UI, making it easy to improve.  Currently the only learning models are fairly simple.


** INSTALL NOTES:
Note, your mysql database must have a reasonable character set.

in mysql shell, type "STATUS" command to tell.
if it's latin1, try drop dbbpy and then
create database dbbpy character set = ucs2;

To load all BLCU content, run:
 python flashcards/bulk_loader.py content/vocab-all-blcu.csv


** DREAMHOST NOTES:
The production system is running on Dreamhost.
Pay attention to settings.py on production.
dojango in installed_apps in settings.py causes "Premature end of script headers."

need to add line
	if sys.version < "2.6": os.execl("/home/username/opt/bin/python", "python", *sys.argv)
to passenger_wsgi.py near top to get it to run correct version of python.
(Needs at least 2.4 or something)



** DEVELOPMENT NOTES, TODO ROADMAP:


TODO...
*Most important
!!!refactor get_deckstate(request) into Deckstate.get_by_request(request).
similar for learning model.
!-pre-load next card in studyui
-warn user when the deck is running short and time for more cards
-include names of lessons added to deck.
-Show me how far I've gotten on each lesson.  (# in each state)
-use static media files


* UX flow
-guest login
-add "about" page
(sorta)-properly sort bloc lessons
-link to definitions
-note about what happens to new cards and the active deck on lesson picker view
-explain how to install chinese fonts
-Better behavior if your deck is empty and you try to study


*code cleanup
-studyui only shows buttons that current model is configured for
-break studyui.js into sections or separate files
-encapsulation of login/logout from root urls.py


*new deck manager
-reset option per card (revisit does that?)
-support multiple decks and switching between them
-option to load more than 30 recent cards
-show which lessons are in this deck
-create a new kind of deck -- quiz / review


*better model
-history looks up actual impressions
-model uses timer
-limit timer to 5 minutes.  then ask "you still there?"



*optimize
-move studyui.html to static media
-move .js and .css out of studyui.
-preload dojo, css on homepage




*More Content
-amharic alphabet
-Organize lessons into a tree
-import cedict
-audio support
-custom widget to choose concepts in a lessonseq
-lesson grouping into topics
-generalize which assettypes to display
-use lessonsequence in learningmodel to derive order
-"card" concept for which types of assets
-hints in studyui


*DnD deck manager
-allow saving of active/discard back to server
-radio-button the selections.  only highlight one total.  not highlight one per column like it does now.
-Don't gray the before/after of the drop target
-break out static .css and .js


*Tests
-Add some tests!
