** INSTALLATION NOTES **
Note, your mysql database must have a reasonable character set.

First, open a mysql shell with "./manage.py dbshell"
Then type "STATUS" command to tell what your character set is.
if it's latin1, you'll need to drop the database and start over.  Use:
mysql> drop dbbpy 
mysql> create database dbbpy character set = ucs2;

Then you'll need to "./manage.py syncdb", etc

To load all BLCU content, run:
 python flashcards/bulk_loader.py content/vocab-all-blcu.csv


** DREAMHOST NOTES:
The production system is running on Dreamhost.
Pay attention to settings.py on production.
dojango in installed_apps in settings.py causes "Premature end of script headers."

need to add line
	if sys.version < "2.6": os.execl("/home/username/opt/bin/python", "python", *sys.argv)
to passenger_wsgi.py near top to get it to run correct version of python.
(Needs at least 2.4 or something)


** 503 errors on /study/getqa on Android

This appears to be a bug in the Android browser.  It doesn't set the 
content-length HTTP request header.  This triggers a rule in mod_security
causing a 503 error to get served.  To workaround, add the following line to 
.htaccess:

SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI ^/study/getqa.*$ MODSEC_ENABLE=Off
